# Configuration file of docker-registry using docker-compose

The project base on [docker-registry](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry) and [docker-registry-fronted](https://github.com/kwk/docker-registry-frontend).

I just use docker-compose to make those tool to easy to use. Only one instruction you need to run can start whole registry service.

    docker-compose up
